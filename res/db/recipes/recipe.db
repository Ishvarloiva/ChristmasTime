Pour over half the dark rum and half the port, then cover and leave to soak overnight.<br><br>The next day, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas 2. Grease a springform cake tin (roughly 26cm) with a little butter, then sprinkle a little flour around the sides and the bottom of the tin, tipping out any excess.<br><br>Sift the flour, allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of salt into a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, beating well before adding the next, then stir in the soaked fruit and soaking liquid. Fold in the flour mixture until combined.<br><br>Spoon the cake mixture into the prepared cake tin, then place in the hot oven for around 2 hours, or until golden and an inserted skewer comes out clean.<br><br>Once ready, poke holes all over the top of the cake, using a skewer. Combine the remaining port and rum in a jug, then pour it over the cake while it's still warm. Set the cake aside to cool completely, then remove from the tin and place on a large platter or plate.<br><br>Separate the egg whites (keep the yolks for another day) and place into a large bowl, then whisk well until frothy. Sift the icing sugar into another large bowl, then gradually add it, a tablespoon at a time, to the egg whites, mixing continuously until combined. Stir in the lemon juice, then beat the icing until stiff peaks form. Decorate the cooled cake with the icing - use a palette knife to spread it over the top and sides, scuffing it up slightly so you get little peaks. Leave to harden, then serve.
id39 = In a toaster or under a grill, toast the bread slices on both sides until dark brown. Leave to cool, then pulse in a food processor to make rough crumbs.<br>Heat half the butter in a saucepan and cook the onion gently for about 10 mins until just starting to brown and turn sticky. Add the bay leaf and thyme, and pour over the milk. Mix in the spices and season with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 5 mins.<br>Remove the herbs, then stir in all but a handful of the crumbs and cook over a low heat, simmering gently, until thickened. For a very smooth sauce, blitz with a hand blender in the pan. Can be chilled for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 months, then reheated to serve.<br>While the sauce simmers, melt the remaining butter in a small frying pan and cook until sizzling and nut-brown. Throw in the remaining crumbs and cook in the butter until really crisp, then turn off the heat.<br>Add the cream to the sauce and heat for a few mins more, then tip into a serving dish. Spoon over the crisp crumbs and any remaining nutty butter to serve.
id40 = <list><br><li>For the chocolate sauce<br><li>100 g butter , plus a small knob<br><li>50 g light brown sugar<br><li>100 g good-quality dark chocolate (70%25 cocoa solids)<br><li>2 tablespoons milk<br><li>For the pudding<br><li>100 g butter<br><li>75 g light brown sugar<br><li>225 g self-raising flour<br><li>2 large free-range eggs<br><li>50 g cocoa<br><li>8 tablespoons milk<br><li>1 pinch salt<br><li>1 orange , zest of, or 2 clementines<br><li>To serve<br><li>1 pot ready-made custard<br></list><br><br>To make the sauce, grease a 2-pint pudding basin with a little butter and set aside. Place a large heatproof mixing bowl over a pan of simmering water (make sure it's not too tight a fit or the steam will burn you). Add all of your sauce ingredients and allow to melt, stirring frequently until blended and glossy. Remove from the heat.<br><br>Pour about 8 tablespoons of your lovely sauce into the bottom of the greased pudding basin and put the rest to one side for later.<br><br>Next, pop all the pudding ingredients into a food processor and blitz until nice and smooth. You can also do this by hand with a wooden spoon if you don't have a food processor. Gently transfer the mixture to the pudding basin, on top of the sauce.<br><br>Cover the pudding basin with some greaseproof paper and a layer of foil to hold it in place. Scrunch this around the edges and tie some string around the basin to secure it. At the same time, make a handle from the string so it is easier to handle the pudding basin later on.<br><br>When you're ready to cook your pudding, get a saucepan large enough to hold the pudding basin and have its lid on tightly, so try it for size first. Once you've got a good fit, place a heatproof plate on the bottom of the pan - this will stop the bottom of the pudding from burning.<br><br>Fill the pan with a couple of inches of boiling water from the kettle and carefully lower your pudding in. The water should come halfway up your pudding, so top it up if you need to.<br><br>Bring the water to the boil, put the lid on, then simmer for about 1%26%23189%3B hours, making sure you keep the water topped up when needed so it doesn't boil dry. After this time, carefully remove your pudding from the pan.<br><br>Turn the pudding out onto a nice big platter, but keep in mind that the chocolate sauce is going to be hot and runny, so be very careful. Place the pudding in the centre of your table with a jug of warmed custard and a jug containing the remaining warmed chocolate sauce. Top the pudding with a little holly and let everyone tuck in 
id41 = <list><li>4 slices prosciutto</li><br><li>750g medium sprouts, trimmed and outer leaves removed</li><br><li>50g butter</li><br><li>finely grated zest 1/4 lemon</li><br></list><br>Heat a large frying pan and cook the prosciutto in batches, laying the slices flat in the pan until brown and crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside.<br>Steam or boil the sprouts for 7-8 mins until just tender, drain and return to the pan with the butter, lemon zest and some seasoning. Turn the sprouts until well coated, then tip into a serving bowl, tear over the crispy prosciutto and season with freshly ground black pepper.
id42 = <list><br><li>300 g dairy-free dark chocolate<br><li>3 tablespoons coconut oil<br><li>240 ml light coconut milk<br><li>1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste , or vanilla extract<br><li>1 handful of desiccated coconut<br><li>1 handful of mixed nuts , such as pecans, hazelnuts and macadamias<br><li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder <br></list><br><br>Chop the chocolate into small pieces, then place into a bowl with the coconut oil. Heat the coconut milk in a small pan over a low heat, then pour into the bowl and stir gently to combine - it's important not to mix too quickly.<br><br>Stir in the vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract. Cover the bowl with cling film, then place in the fridge to set for at least 4 hours.<br><br>When the truffle mixture has almost set, toast the desiccated coconut over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly golden. Tip onto a plate, then return the pan to a medium heat and add the nuts. Toast for around 2 minutes, or until golden, then leave to cool for a few minutes. Finely chop, then place onto a second plate. Spread out the cocoa powder onto a third plate.<br><br>Using a teaspoon, scoop out little balls of the truffle mixture and roll in the palm of your hands, placing them onto a tray as you go. It's totally up to you how you decorate them - roll the balls in either the toasted coconut or chopped nuts, or for a simple finish, roll them in the cocoa powder. Return the decorated truffles to the fridge for around 10 minutes to firm up, then serve.
