Pour over half the dark rum and half the port, then cover and leave to soak overnight.<br><br>The next day, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas 2. Grease a springform cake tin (roughly 26cm) with a little butter, then sprinkle a little flour around the sides and the bottom of the tin, tipping out any excess.<br><br>Sift the flour, allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of salt into a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, beating well before adding the next, then stir in the soaked fruit and soaking liquid. Fold in the flour mixture until combined.<br><br>Spoon the cake mixture into the prepared cake tin, then place in the hot oven for around 2 hours, or until golden and an inserted skewer comes out clean.<br><br>Once ready, poke holes all over the top of the cake, using a skewer. Combine the remaining port and rum in a jug, then pour it over the cake while it's still warm. Set the cake aside to cool completely, then remove from the tin and place on a large platter or plate.<br><br>Separate the egg whites (keep the yolks for another day) and place into a large bowl, then whisk well until frothy. Sift the icing sugar into another large bowl, then gradually add it, a tablespoon at a time, to the egg whites, mixing continuously until combined. Stir in the lemon juice, then beat the icing until stiff peaks form. Decorate the cooled cake with the icing - use a palette knife to spread it over the top and sides, scuffing it up slightly so you get little peaks. Leave to harden, then serve.
id39 = In a toaster or under a grill, toast the bread slices on both sides until dark brown. Leave to cool, then pulse in a food processor to make rough crumbs.<br>Heat half the butter in a saucepan and cook the onion gently for about 10 mins until just starting to brown and turn sticky. Add the bay leaf and thyme, and pour over the milk. Mix in the spices and season with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 5 mins.<br>Remove the herbs, then stir in all but a handful of the crumbs and cook over a low heat, simmering gently, until thickened. For a very smooth sauce, blitz with a hand blender in the pan. Can be chilled for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 months, then reheated to serve.<br>While the sauce simmers, melt the remaining butter in a small frying pan and cook until sizzling and nut-brown. Throw in the remaining crumbs and cook in the butter until really crisp, then turn off the heat.<br>Add the cream to the sauce and heat for a few mins more, then tip into a serving dish. Spoon over the crisp crumbs and any remaining nutty butter to serve.
id40 = <list><li>For the chocolate sauce<li>100 g butter , plus a small knob<li>50 g light brown sugar<li>100 g good-quality dark chocolate (70%25 cocoa solids)<br><li>2 tablespoons milk<br><li>For the pudding<br><li>100 g butter<br><li>75 g light brown sugar<br><li>225 g self-raising flour<br><li>2 large free-range eggs<br><li>50 g cocoa<br><li>8 tablespoons milk<br><li>1 pinch salt<br><li>1 orange , zest of, or 2 clementines<br><li>To serve<br><li>1 pot ready-made custard<br></list><br><br>To make the sauce, grease a 2-pint pudding basin with a little butter and set aside. Place a large heatproof mixing bowl over a pan of simmering water (make sure it's not too tight a fit or the steam will burn you). Add all of your sauce ingredients and allow to melt, stirring frequently until blended and glossy. Remove from the heat.<br><br>Pour about 8 tablespoons of your lovely sauce into the bottom of the greased pudding basin and put the rest to one side for later.<br><br>Next, pop all the pudding ingredients into a food processor and blitz until nice and smooth. You can also do this by hand with a wooden spoon if you don't have a food processor. Gently transfer the mixture to the pudding basin, on top of the sauce.<br><br>Cover the pudding basin with some greaseproof paper and a layer of foil to hold it in place. Scrunch this around the edges and tie some string around the basin to secure it. At the same time, make a handle from the string so it is easier to handle the pudding basin later on.<br><br>When you're ready to cook your pudding, get a saucepan large enough to hold the pudding basin and have its lid on tightly, so try it for size first. Once you've got a good fit, place a heatproof plate on the bottom of the pan - this will stop the bottom of the pudding from burning.<br><br>Fill the pan with a couple of inches of boiling water from the kettle and carefully lower your pudding in. The water should come halfway up your pudding, so top it up if you need to.<br><br>Bring the water to the boil, put the lid on, then simmer for about 1%26%23189%3B hours, making sure you keep the water topped up when needed so it doesn't boil dry. After this time, carefully remove your pudding from the pan.<br><br>Turn the pudding out onto a nice big platter, but keep in mind that the chocolate sauce is going to be hot and runny, so be very careful. Place the pudding in the centre of your table with a jug of warmed custard and a jug containing the remaining warmed chocolate sauce. Top the pudding with a little holly and let everyone tuck in 
id41 = <list><li>4 slices prosciutto<li>750g medium sprouts, trimmed and outer leaves removed<li>50g butter<li>finely grated zest 1/4 lemon</list><br><br>Heat a large frying pan and cook the prosciutto in batches, laying the slices flat in the pan until brown and crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside.<br>Steam or boil the sprouts for 7-8 mins until just tender, drain and return to the pan with the butter, lemon zest and some seasoning. Turn the sprouts until well coated, then tip into a serving bowl, tear over the crispy prosciutto and season with freshly ground black pepper.
id42 = <list><li>300 g dairy-free dark chocolate<li>3 tablespoons coconut oil<li>240 ml light coconut milk<li>1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste , or vanilla extract<li>1 handful of desiccated coconut<li>1 handful of mixed nuts , such as pecans, hazelnuts and macadamias<li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder</list><br><br>Chop the chocolate into small pieces, then place into a bowl with the coconut oil. Heat the coconut milk in a small pan over a low heat, then pour into the bowl and stir gently to combine - it's important not to mix too quickly.<br><br>Stir in the vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract. Cover the bowl with cling film, then place in the fridge to set for at least 4 hours.<br><br>When the truffle mixture has almost set, toast the desiccated coconut over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until lightly golden. Tip onto a plate, then return the pan to a medium heat and add the nuts. Toast for around 2 minutes, or until golden, then leave to cool for a few minutes. Finely chop, then place onto a second plate. Spread out the cocoa powder onto a third plate.<br><br>Using a teaspoon, scoop out little balls of the truffle mixture and roll in the palm of your hands, placing them onto a tray as you go. It's totally up to you how you decorate them - roll the balls in either the toasted coconut or chopped nuts, or for a simple finish, roll them in the cocoa powder. Return the decorated truffles to the fridge for around 10 minutes to firm up, then serve.
id43 = <list><li>1kg pack carrot(preferably organic), sliced<li>50g butter<li> 1 tbsp chopped tarragon leaves</list><br><br>Boil the carrots in salted water for 20-25 mins until tender. Drain in a colander and leave to steam-dry for 1-2 mins. Return to the pan with the butter and roughly mash if you would like a little texture in them, or blitz with a hand blender for a silky-smooth puree. Season well and stir in the tarragon. Will keep in the fridge for 3 days. Reheat in the microwave for 2-3 mins, or in a pan.
id44 = <list><li>1 whole unsmoked leg of gammon (about 4kg-5kg), on the bone<li>150ml apple juice<li>2 cinnamon sticks<li>2 star anise<li>Star aniseplus 8-12 to serve (optional)<li>10 whole peppercorns<li>6 cloves<li>Cloves<li>4 bay leaves<li>pared zest 1 orange<li>Orange<li>5 small apples<li>Apples<li>edible gold spray, to decorate (optional)<li>bay leaves, to decorate (optional)<li>pared orange zest, to decorate (optional)<li>For the glaze<li>250ml maple syrup<li>50ml apple juice<li>1 tsp ground cinnamon<li>1 tsp ground ginger<li>1/2 tsp ground cloves<li>2 tbsp wholegrain mustard</list><br><br>If your gammon needs to be soaked to draw out some of the salt (ask your butcher), place in a clean bucket or a preserving pan and cover with cold water. Chill overnight, or for up to 3 days.<br><br>Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. If the ham has been soaking, drain it well and place in a large, deep-sided roasting tin. Pour in the apple juice and top up with 400ml water. Add the spices, bay leaves and orange zest. Cover the ham tightly with a few large sheets of foil, scrunching it around the edges of the tin so no steam can escape, then bake for 5 hrs. Meanwhile, mix together the ingredients for the glaze in a saucepan, then bubble until reduced to a sticky glaze. Score the apples around their equator with a small, sharp knife.<br><br>Remove the ham from the oven and increase the temperature to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Carefully transfer the ham to a board - the easiest way to do this is to leave it to cool for 10 mins, then pop on clean washing- up gloves to lift it. Pour away the cooking liquid and discard the aromatics. Use a small, sharp knife to cut and peel away the rind, leaving a thin layer of fat attached to the meat. Line your roasting tin with a few sheets of foil and place the ham in the middle, fat-side up. Use a sharp knife to lightly score the fat in a criss-cross pattern. Return the ham to the oven and bake for 30 mins until the fat starts to crisp and caramelise.<br><br>    If the glaze has become a little thick, splash in a drop of water to loosen it, then brush all over the ham. Place the whole apples in the tin too, and return to the oven for another 20-30 mins, basting the ham every now and then, until dark and sticky all over.<br><br>    Before serving, mash the whole apples (discard the stalks, skin and pips) with a little of the sticky sauce from the roasting tin. We decorated our ham with star anise, sprayed with edible gold spray, and arranged bay leaves and orange peel around the board. Serve warm slices of the ham with the apple sauce, or cold in sandwiches. Will keep for up to 1 week in the fridge, or slice and store in the freezer for up to 2 months.<br><br>

Squeeze the juice. Put the zests and juice into a large saucepan, then add the Port and remaining ingredients. Simmer very gently for 20 mins, then leave to cool completely. Can be made up to 1 week ahead and chilled. To serve, 'frost' the glasses if desired , put ice and slices of orange and lemon in each glass, then carefully pour in equal quantities of the Port and lemonade.
id46 = <list><li>8 slices bacon<br><li>1 tablespoon garlic powder<br><li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt<br><li>1 teaspoon dried basil<br><li>1 teaspoon dried oregano<br><li>2 pounds pork tenderloin<br><li>2 tablespoons butter<br><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</list><br><br>Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).<br>Place the bacon in a large, oven-safe skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until lightly browned and still flexible, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Remove any excess bacon grease from the skillet. Combine garlic powder, seasoning salt, basil, and oregano in a small bowl. Set aside.<br>Wrap the pork tenderloin with the bacon strips securing with 1 or 2 toothpicks per strip of bacon. Slice the tenderloin between each bacon strip to create the medallions. Dip both sides of the medallions in seasoning mix. Melt butter and oil together in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each medallion for 4 minutes on each side.<br>Place skillet into the preheated oven and bake until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 17 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).<br>
