Pour over half the dark rum and half the port, then cover and leave to soak overnight.<br><br>The next day, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas 2. Grease a springform cake tin (roughly 26cm) with a little butter, then sprinkle a little flour around the sides and the bottom of the tin, tipping out any excess.<br><br>Sift the flour, allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of salt into a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, beating well before adding the next, then stir in the soaked fruit and soaking liquid. Fold in the flour mixture until combined.<br><br>Spoon the cake mixture into the prepared cake tin, then place in the hot oven for around 2 hours, or until golden and an inserted skewer comes out clean.<br><br>Once ready, poke holes all over the top of the cake, using a skewer. Combine the remaining port and rum in a jug, then pour it over the cake while it's still warm. Set the cake aside to cool completely, then remove from the tin and place on a large platter or plate.<br><br>Separate the egg whites (keep the yolks for another day) and place into a large bowl, then whisk well until frothy. Sift the icing sugar into another large bowl, then gradually add it, a tablespoon at a time, to the egg whites, mixing continuously until combined. Stir in the lemon juice, then beat the icing until stiff peaks form. Decorate the cooled cake with the icing - use a palette knife to spread it over the top and sides, scuffing it up slightly so you get little peaks. Leave to harden, then serve.
id39 = In a toaster or under a grill, toast the bread slices on both sides until dark brown. Leave to cool, then pulse in a food processor to make rough crumbs.<br>Heat half the butter in a saucepan and cook the onion gently for about 10 mins until just starting to brown and turn sticky. Add the bay leaf and thyme, and pour over the milk. Mix in the spices and season with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 5 mins.<br>Remove the herbs, then stir in all but a handful of the crumbs and cook over a low heat, simmering gently, until thickened. For a very smooth sauce, blitz with a hand blender in the pan. Can be chilled for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 2 months, then reheated to serve.<br>While the sauce simmers, melt the remaining butter in a small frying pan and cook until sizzling and nut-brown. Throw in the remaining crumbs and cook in the butter until really crisp, then turn off the heat.<br>Add the cream to the sauce and heat for a few mins more, then tip into a serving dish. Spoon over the crisp crumbs and any remaining nutty butter to serve.
