Roughly chop the prunes and candied fruit, then place in a large bowl with the other dried fruit. Pour over half the dark rum and half the port, then cover and leave to soak overnight.

The next day, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas 2. Grease a springform cake tin (roughly 26cm) with a little butter, then sprinkle a little flour around the sides and the bottom of the tin, tipping out any excess.

Sift the flour, allspice, nutmeg and a pinch of salt into a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy. Crack in the eggs, one at a time, beating well before adding the next, then stir in the soaked fruit and soaking liquid. Fold in the flour mixture until combined.

Spoon the cake mixture into the prepared cake tin, then place in the hot oven for around 2 hours, or until golden and an inserted skewer comes out clean.

Once ready, poke holes all over the top of the cake, using a skewer. Combine the remaining port and rum in a jug, then pour it over the cake while it’s still warm. Set the cake aside to cool completely, then remove from the tin and place on a large platter or plate.

Separate the egg whites (keep the yolks for another day) and place into a large bowl, then whisk well until frothy. Sift the icing sugar into another large bowl, then gradually add it, a tablespoon at a time, to the egg whites, mixing continuously until combined. Stir in the lemon juice, then beat the icing until stiff peaks form. Decorate the cooled cake with the icing – use a palette knife to spread it over the top and sides, scuffing it up slightly so you get little peaks. Leave to harden, then serve.
