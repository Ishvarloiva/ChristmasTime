Website project for e-business course.
Made by Vadim Prokopev (me) and Aleksander Semjonov.
Made using HTML, 960.gs, JavaScript and Soy templates.
There are five static pages and dynamic page for recipes.
In order to make dynamic page running you need webserver written by my friend. It can be found here: https://github.com/Kos94ok/WebServer
